# Benchmarking data stream outlier detection methods

### Main Contributions
Data stream datasets have characteristics depending on the underlying domain and context. From their proximity to time series, we can characterize a data stream by the presence of  seasonality, trend, and cycle; due to the way data are arriving, we can add concept drift which is a non-negligible phenomenon which currently occurs in data stream context.

## Methods compared
As it's the case for most of the anomaly detection methods, the following methods produce an anomaly score for each incoming instance showing how well the instance could be an anomaly, finally a threshold fixed by the user permits to say that instances with anomaly scores higher than the threshold are anomalies. In the literature, data stream anomaly detection methods are mostly separated into statistical based, tree based, proximity based and deep learning based approaches. We have chosen highly used and recommended approaches in each of those categories. 

Methods:
1. [Online ARIMA](https://github.com/petrospgithub/onlinearima) : Statistic based methods which provide the anomaly score by computing the distance between the value of the instance forecasted from past instances and the real value of the instance. 

3. [HStree](https://github.com/yli96/HSTree) : Tree based approach, providing the anomaly score according to how well an instance is isolated from other instances in an ensemble of pre-constructed trees
4. [IforestASD](https://github.com/MariamBARRY/skmultiflow_IForestASD) : Similar to HStree
5. [KitNet]([https://github.com/ymirsky/KitNET-py) : Deep learning based methods  providing the anomaly score as the reconstruction error of an instance (Autoencoder)
6. [MILOF](https://github.com/dingwentao/MILOF) : Proximity based approach, providing the anomaly score according to how locally reachable is an instance compared to its nearest neighbours. 

## Datasets and their characteristics
We selected datasets mostly from IOT domain and whose anomalies causes are known to avoid errors due to human or tools labeling. In the boards, **no** trend means the dataset has a constant trend. Those characteristics have been identified by visualizing the datasets and are support by STL decompositions for trends and seasonalities.

## Description of the experimental protocol
For each dataset, a bayesian optimization is performed to find best hyperparameters (details of the hyperparameter search space of each method could be found in the implementation details (page 8) section of the [summary_of_the_experiment](https://github.com/nams2000/anomaly-detection-in-data-stream/blob/master/summary_of_the_experiments.pdf) file), then we test the method with the best hyperparameters and record the execution time and the f1-score. Finally we process the latence or response time (average time to treat an instance) (**latence =the execution time on the dataset/length of the dataset**). To process the f1-score, we consider a method find an anomaly if it 1% of the length of the dataset around the position of the anomaly (this because an anomaly generaly occurs on a small period and the point given as the position of the anomaly is a point inside the period on which the anomaly occured).

## Results
Due to conception restrictions KitNet couldn't be applied on univariate datasets and Online ARIMA can't be applied on multivariate datasets.
